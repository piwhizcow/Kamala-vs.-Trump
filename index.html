<h1>Kamala vs. Trump</h1>
<h2>Who should you vote for?</h2>

			   So, with the election coming
			in about two weeks, who should 
			you vote for? Kamala or Trump?
			The two most likely candidates.
			They have very different plans				
			for if they are elected. Before
			we discuss their plans, we should
			learn about who they are, to 
			determine how likely they are going
			to do what they claim they are
			going to do. I will use a few different
			websites because this is very complicated.
			Lets dive into it. Notice the video below
			has one of Trumps relatives and one of his
			classmates and the person Trump wrote a book  			
			with.
