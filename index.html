<h1>Kamala vs. Trump</h1>
<h2>Who should you vote for?</h2>

			   So, with the election coming
			in about two weeks, who should 
			you vote for? Kamala or Trump?
			The two most likely candidates.
			They have very different plans				
			for if they are elected. Before
			we discuss their plans, we should
			learn about who they are, to 
			determine how likely they are going
			to do what they claim they are
			going to do. I will use a few different
			websites because this is very complicated.
			Lets dive into it. Notice the video below
			has one of Trumps relatives and one of his
			classmates and the person Trump wrote a book  			
			with.

			Trump got a bachelor's degree in 1968.
                        Trump inherited more than 400 million			
			dollars and a real estate bussiness from 
			his father. Remember, Trump grew closer
			to his father, who was arrested twice.
			Trump had a lot of failed businesses,
			including the Trump Taj Mahal, the Trump
			Plaza, the Trump Castle, the Plaza Hotel,
			THCR all were failed businesses. Trump
			Hotels & Casino Resorts went bankrupt
			and was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts
			Inc. went bankrupt a second time. Trump
			Shuttle Inc., Trump University, Trump
			Vodka, Trump Mortgage,LLC are more
			failed businesses. Trumps highest money
			making businesses are Trump National Doral,
			Trump Old Post, Trump Ruffin Tower, Trump
			Turnberry, and Mar-a-Lago club. His 
			businesses have lost tens of thousands
			of dollars from 2000-2018. Trump,
			a man surrounded in luxury failed to
			make profit with a good start of 400
			million dollars.
