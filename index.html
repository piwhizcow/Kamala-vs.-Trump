<h1>Kamala vs. Trump</h1>
<h2>Who should you vote for?</h2>

			   So, with the election coming
			in about two weeks, who should 
			you vote for? Kamala or Trump?
			The two most likely candidates.
			They have very different plans				
			for if they are elected. Before
			we discuss their plans, we should
			learn about who they are, to 
			determine how likely they are going
			to do what they claim they are
			going to do. I will use a few different
			sources because this is very complicated.
			Notice the people in the video below
			are his classmate and his neice.
			Lets dive into it.

			Trump got a bachelor's degree in 1968.
                        Trump inherited more than 400 million			
			dollars and a real estate bussiness from 
			his father. Remember, Trump grew closer
			to his father, who was arrested twice.
			Trump had a lot of failed businesses,
			including the Trump Taj Mahal, the Trump
			Plaza, the Trump Castle, the Plaza Hotel,
			THCR all were failed businesses. Trump
			Hotels & Casino Resorts went bankrupt
			and was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts
			Inc. went bankrupt a second time. Trump
			Shuttle Inc., Trump University, Trump
			Vodka, Trump Mortgage,LLC are more
			failed businesses. Trumps highest money
			making businesses are Trump National Doral,
			Trump Old Post, Trump Ruffin Tower, Trump
			Turnberry, and Mar-a-Lago club. His 
			businesses have lost tens of thousands
			of dollars from 2000-2018. Trump,
			a man surrounded in luxury failed to
			make profit with a good start of 400
			million dollars. Trump became president
			on January 20, people have different opinions
			of whether he did a good job. For a
			list of his actions;

<h1> Attack on the Capitol and the Coming Election</h1>			

			   On January 6, 2021, Trump allegedly encouraged
			his suporters to attack the capitol because
			he lost the election. Trump claimed voter
			fraud, without evidence. This is unacceptable
			behaviour from the president, it shows
			that he is a dangerous manipulative
			person. I have to say to Trumps 
			supporters through and through,
		        Did Trump help attack the capitol?
			No, he sat back and let you do the
			dirty work, he also let you take the 
			punishment too. He sees you as a tool.
			To get him what he wants. This crowd 
			attacked police officers and threatened
			lawmakers. Trump claims it was a 
			protest, but when the lawmaker were
			the ones threatened, that crossed the
			line. Trump was attacking our 
			democracy with no evidence. Trump was
			a "killer" who tried to bully the 
			U.S. into getting what he wants.
			This year, two presidential debates
			have taken place, Trump attemps
			to bully his opponents to keep them
			off their A game. This is Trumps
			history. Trumps partner Vance, said
			someone needed to be fact checking 
			Kamala, so here is the fact checked
			debate.

<h1>The History of Kamala Harris </h1>				
		 
			 
			    A lot of people don't know Kamala
			Harris, but we can learn a lot about
			her based on what she says and does.
			Kamala was born in the year 1964, she
			had a sister a few years later. Her
			parents were divorced in 1972. She 
			went to Howard University to study
			political science and economics. She
			got a law degree in 1989 at the University
			of California College of the Law. Harris's
			mother died of breast cancer in 2009. Harris
			recalled something her mom said to her,"Kamala
			you may be the first to do many things. Make
			sure you are not the last." You may be
			wondering, why is this important? The 
			answer is that this is the lesson Kamala
			took to heart. These are the jobs Kamala
			had before presidency; deputy district attorney
			(1990), district attorney (2004), and attorney
			general (2010). Her job choice tells us she
			feels like people aren't being brought to
			justice. She feels she can make a bigger
			difference when on offense. Kind of the
			good offense is a good defense mentality.
			She got the U.S. Senate seat in 2017.
			All these jobs are involved with the
			government, meaning she was perseverent
			and pationate to changing the world. She 
			failed to acquire the presidential nomination
			from the democrats for the 2020 election.
			Biden, who gained the nominee selected Kamala
			as his partner. They won the 2020 election.
			For information on what Kamala did as vice
			president;

			With all this information, what does this
			tell us about Kamala? Well she is a black 
			woman, and she had divorced parents, she
			had a hard life, she struggled. She had
			double prejudice against her. Although
			we have tried to eliminate the prejudices,
			I still hear people use the words "guys"
			informally. These prejudices show up a 
			lot as we don't think woman are smart.
			For example, none of our presidents
			have been woman, which means Kamala
			would've had to work very hard to 
			get into the position she is in 
			now. Struggle has a way of forcing
			someone to learn resilience and
			prudence. Resilience comes from
			surviving hardships. Prudence comes with it
			because that person will do whatever
			it takes to prevent something from
			happening again. I don't see Kamala
			as a mystery, I see her as a hard
			working woman who pushed past 
			prejudices by being twice as good
			as all the other options. Unfortunately
			this is the way things are, woman having
			to work harder to achieve the same state 
			as a man. She has asserted her position
			that she wants to help the U.S. and 
			working americans.
